But it's not world domination I'm after. I know four things robots can do right now that will change our lives for the future, and all in a good way. The first is entertainment (done that), the second is grunt work in dangerous places (coming up), third is elderly care, and last but not least is telepresence shopping, tourism, and assistance.

Imagine sitting at your computer and controlling a video game character through a mall or market, except it's not a game, it's a robot shopping for you in Tokyo while you sit comfortably in London. With a live video and audio feed so you could haggle, you drive a legged humanoid robot about your size so you get a good sense of what would fit, and afterwards you go for a walk to see what the countryside has to offer

Robotic engineers are designing the next generation of robots to look, feel and act more human, to make it  easier for us to warm up to a cold machine.
The brain behind the beauty will be the key to turning a realistic looking machine into a life like robot. AI plays a pivotal role in successful human/robot interaction.

+Will Robots Take Our Children’s Jobs?
“I think health coaches are going to be a big industry of the future,” he said. 
“Restaurants that have a very good hospitality staff are not about to go away, even though we have more options to order via tablet.
“People who are interested in working with their hands, they’re going to be fine,” he said. “The robot plumber is a long, long way away.”

+How to teach robot in a right way.
Robots need to be efficient, but not in a way that leads them to bad behaviors like cutting in line, stealing, or physically harming people.
So virtually anyone could program a robot or program an agent in AI simply by telling stories. We don't have to teach people how to teach computers. -> easy to use and train.
Just like how the robots were made with the people’s imaginations, the robots’ problems can be fixed with the imaginations of both the consumer and the producers. People are protesting on how the government or major corporations shouldn’t invest in robot-tech because these robots will only bring negative impacts to the society because of their flaws, but the irony about this is that as robotic technology advances with further support from major businesses, these flaws will not only get fixed, but removed all together allowing for a more positive future for both robots and humans.
